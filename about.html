        <h1>Hana Raouf</h1>
        <pre>
    I'm an 18 Year old, Third Year Digital Media Design 
    Student at the University of hertfordshire in Egypt.
    Currently I am most engulfed in 3D Design as a whole, however, 
    I'm also interested in an array of other mediums as well.
    I've always had a passion for several creative discplines. 
    For instance, ever since I was a child, I loved to write and create.
